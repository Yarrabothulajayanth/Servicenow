internship project
The Automated Car Catalog System project was initiated to improve the efficiency of managing car catalogs in showrooms and dealerships. Manual handling of car models, customer requests, approvals, and task assignments often led to delays, errors, and decreased customer satisfaction.
The solution leverages ServiceNow Service Catalog and Workflow to provide a dynamic, automated, and user-friendly system. Customers can submit requests easily, approvals are automated, and tasks are efficiently assigned to showroom staff. This project demonstrates how ServiceNow enhances operational efficiency, reduces manual effort, and improves the overall customer and employee experience.
